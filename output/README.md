##### In this project,using text of inaugural speeches from US presidents from Andrew Jackson to Donal Trump, I analyzed emotions, sentence lengths and topics of each president's speech, and the relationships between these and variables such as era and party affiliation are stated as follows.

##### There are four parts in this report. First, I examine if presidents from different political parties differ in emotion, sentence length and topics in their speeches. Second, I analyze the influence on speeches by historial eras. I state my conclusion in Part 3 and list resources I refered to in Part 4.

##### Conlusion : In this project I did an analysis of emotions, sentence lengths and topics of some U.S. president's speech, and drew a conclusion as follows. Party affiliation does not influence presidents' speech topics as expected. This may due to the fact that the policies and positions of both parties largely changed through different periods. And we did oberserve a relationship between the main focus of some presidents and their places in history.
